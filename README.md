# Project's motivation

Our team decided to dive deep into various features that may act as crucial in determining as to who can be strongly  or moderately impacted by the MERS Coronavirus.

The current state in the healthcare industry is problematic; it is difficult to lower the risk of contagion if vulnerable people are not identified beforehand.
The ideal state with our model will be to predict beforehand the risk of fatality for each individual.


# Our initial assumptions
Localization, gender, age, a job as healthcare worker and environement are variables which might determine the fatality of an individual towards the MERS Coronavirus.
